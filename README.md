## Overview

This lab is little bit different than the labs you've completed thus far! In this lab, you'll explore the topic of machine learning (ML) similar to how Chapter 7 of TBoD does using your data visualization skills: by solving a classification problem and putting together a dashboard to tweak your algorithm's parameters to observe their performance. While you're welcome to stick to SVMs and perform a classification based on it, you're more than welcome to use any other ML classification techniques as you desire.

## Task 2's Classification Problem
After exploring various binary classification techniques, I discovered a dataset on Kaggle that contains detailed attributes of breast cancer tumors. I was intrigued by how this data could be leveraged to predict and classify new tumors as either cancerous or benign.
